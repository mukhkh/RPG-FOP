The moment you clicked the start button,
you suddenly felt giddy as your whole room
started spinning. You felt like being
sucked into a blackhole. After a few
seconds, you had arrived at a pixelated
world. You looked at yourself and realized
that you were also pixelated. Then, a
mystery voice surrounded your hearing
saying, “Welcome to Vireon World! You are 
the chosen one, well you’re not the only
one, there’s a few but yeah, you’re one
of the chosen to help defend the kingdom
from Viral Monsters and finally free the
kingdom from the evil.
